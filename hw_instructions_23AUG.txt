Ok let's talk about the instructions.

But before that there are a couple things that have been causing some confusion.

It seems not everyone has access to the calendar. I am guessing that is the case with those of you whose email address is not @gmail.com
so I will be sending some screenshots of each month of the calendar in a while. 

Until then, just to be clear, what you should see in the calendar are:
(i) the dates when i will (officially) hand out the item activities (every Monday from now until the end of the semester)
(ii) the due dates for the activities of each item (the Sunday after the hand out of each item)
(iii) and the last chance dates for the activities of each item(the Wednesday after the due date)

Also, remember that in practice I will hand out the items before the official hand out date so you will actually have more time.


Something else is causing confusion with respect to the calendar. On the Mondays I wrote: Send item 01, Send item 02 etc
What I meant was that I WILL SEND item 01, I WILL SEND item 02 etc

Yes, it was a bad choice of words. I should have written something like: releasing item 01 etc  

And , some of you understandably, interpreted that the Mondays are when you have to send the homework to me. But that is not the case.

I release stuff on Monday. 

You have until Sunday to hand it in.

SO THERE IS NOTHING DUE TOMORROW!! 

ITEM 01 is due next Sunday.

Of course you may hand it in ahead of time.

Now for the instructions on handing homework: 

(1) One email per item you are handing in.

(2) subject of the email should be: handing in homework for item [number of the item]

(3) body of the email: your name, your número de matrícula

(4) take a picture of your handwritten answers and attach it. 

(5) One page per picture.

(6) please don't take high resolution pictures or anything like that it just needs to be readable.

(7) please be neat in your writing
