1. What is a (linguistic) constituent? [00:00 - 01:00]


2. Complete the statement to form the first hypothesis for a rule which describes how to form a polar question from a statement:
   (H1) Take the ..... ....... word  and ..... it.



3. What would be some other words that could take the place of 'is'?
	WTF!! I know all of you speak English really really really well so why did so many people say that DO can take the place of 'is' here????

	Mary is tall ---> Is Mary tall? 
	Mary does yoga ---> *Does M yoga?
	Mary seems intelligent ---> *Seems M intelligent?

		NOTICE that 'does M do yoga?' involves MORE THAN JUST FRONTING THE VERB!!!!


		Ok I will stop freaking out now.


4. Not only that but it seems to be the case that children never entertain that as a possible rule for forming yes/no questions in English.



5. Complete the statement to form the second hypothesis for a rule which describes how to form a polar question from a statement:
   (H2) Take the ..... ....... word .... the ......  and ..... it.
   	- many people said TAKE THE FIRST AUXILIARY AFTER A GROUP OF WORDS AND FRONT IT.
     	  ok, not wrong. But 
	  TAKE THE FIRST AUXILIARY AFTER THE SUBJECT AND FRONT IT.
	  is more precise!

6. How does one decide if which hypothesis (H1 or H2) is more apt to describe how polar questions are formed?
	The simplest most direct answer to this question is:
	choose the hypothesis which explains the behaviour of the largest number of (types of) sentences (in the simplest, most succint manner possible)


7. Can a constituent be formed by a single word?

1. What is the property of recursion?
recursion is the property constituents that allows them to contain other constituents of the same type. 



2. How is it important for forming sentences?



3. By what she says, do grammar rules impose a maximum limit to the size of sentences?  NO!



4. So, does grammatical theory have an explanation for why there are no infinite sentences? NO!



5. Where does the explanation for that fact come from? FROM HUMAN LIMITATIONS: finite breath, finite memory, finite patience, finite lives.



6. The Flea in the dog in the car. Analyze this using the box model at 5:03. 

	we want constituents of type X containing other constituents of type X so the best description is:
		
		[The flea [ in [the dog [in [ the car ] ] ] ] ]
	
	this is possible too but does not have a PP inside a PP
		[The flea [in [the dog]] [in [the car]] ]



7. Can you produce an example phrase or sentence that shows recursion at work in Portuguese?
