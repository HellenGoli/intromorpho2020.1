1. "The sequence of words which can be moved around in the sentence..." Complete the sentence [starts at around 01:40]
2. In the sentence 'Mary read that interesting book in the park', find the noun phrase constituent. Use the displacement test.

	that interesting book, Mary read in the park
w
3. Notice: in displacement of verb phrases only the non-finite part is displaced. What are non-finite forms of the verbs bring, eat, ring, play? 
Go to SIEG pg. 36 to answer this question.

	non finites are infinitive, participle and gerund
		so 
			bring, brought, bringing
			eat, eaten, eating
			etc



4. She uses tests to show what sequences of words are constituents but notice that there is something else that constituency testing does for you. It shows which
sequences of words are NOT constituents. So they can help you understand why an analysis is wrong. For example, show that the bracketed sequences are NOT constituents 
by showing that it fails most tests:
	In a 3 cases the fronting test will show that the bracketed groups of words in the 3 sentences ARE NOT CONSTITUENTS

	- Beatrice will read [a thousand] novels.
	*[a thousand], B will read novels.

	- She went to the [city in that] year.
	*[city in that], she went to the year

	- Mary is [incredibly] tall.
	*incredibly, M. is tall 
	Notice that there is a grammatical interpretation for 'incredibly, Mary is tall'
	but it means the same as 'The fact that M is tall is incredible' which cleary 
	does not correspond to the original sentence. 
	But if you are not satisfied with that we can perform another test:
	
	What is Mary? - *[incredibly]
