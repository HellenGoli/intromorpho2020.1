4. What is the head of the constituent 'in the car' in the sentence 'Mary saw the dog in the car'? Support your claim with an argument in the style of her argument at around 03:00 - 04:00
	- the least likely word to be omitted in 'in the car' is 'in' 
	  *M saw the dog the car  .....very ungrammatical! ... what the hell is it saying? we don t even know anymore
	  *M saw the dog in the.  .....still ungrammatical but now we have an idea of what it is saying, it just sounds incomplete

5. "A second fact about the head of a phrase is that it shares...". What does it share with whom? And while we are at it, what was the first fact again? (04:00 - 05:00)
6. Why are these ungrammatical *'A menino levado', *'A dogs'. In your answer use the nouns: head, (grammatical) feature. (As Heycock does in the video) 

	- A menino levado is ungrammatical bc menino is the head word and in PT the dependents (here determiner and adjective) should agree with it in number and gender. The determiner 
	does not agree in gender
	- A dogs is ungrammatical bc dogs is the head word and the determiner A, which is singular, must agree with the head word in number. But in this case the head word is plural.


7. Just notice that she says that visiting is a noun. Should it be a verb? Here is evidence that it should be a noun:
