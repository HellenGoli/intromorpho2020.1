Syntactic Theory pages 21-29 

[page 21]
1. The authors claim 3 objectives for chapter 2. What are they? 
 ---> Notice that we are concerned mainly with objective #1.

[pages 22-23 2.2.1]
2. State briefly in your own words their argument for the claim that there are infinitely many sentences in English(and all other known human languages for that matter).
They give this argument in the paragraph right after example sentences (1)
3. In (2) they present an Impossible (and very annoying) Language. The words in that language are the English words: 'some', 'sentences', 'go', 'on', 'and'. But
the rule is quite absurd. What is that rule? (the state it on page 23)
4. Let's see if you really understand the hypothetical language. Would sentences (i) - (iv) be grammatical nor ungrammatical? Use the asterisk to mark the ungrammatical sentences.
 (i)   Some sentences go on.
 (ii)  Sentences some go on.
 (iii) Some sentences go on and on and on and on and on and on
 (iv)  Sentences some go on and on and on and on and on and on
 
5. If a theory of syntax (i.e., a grammar) were just lists of sentences (and sentences just lists of words with no constituent structure) 
would it be able to explain why sentences of real human languages never behave like those of the Hypothetical language?

[pages 23-24]
6. Having rejected that grammars can be lists of sentences, section 2.2.2 tries a new strategy. What do they propose a grammar consists of in that new strategy?
7. What would the description for 'The cat is on the mat' look like using that strategy?
To deal with limitations of the new strategy they include some new elements in the grammar amongst them, the kleene star. What limitation of the new 
strategy does the kleene star overcome?
8. What do the kleene star and the kleene plus indicate? Why is it important to indicate that sort of thing in a theory of grammar?
9. What does the vertical bar indicate?

[page 25]
Around example (9) on page 25 they state an argument that shows that with the new strategy (now called regular expressions, but we could also just call it 
patterns of grammatical categories) the grammar would be very, very repetitive and complicated. But then they go on to a more crucial problem. 
10. To understand that crucial problem, let's start by doing a constituent analysis of these sentences:
 (v)   We watched the movie with Cher.
 (vi)  I saw the astronomer with the telescope.
 (vii) I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
-------------------------
To do the constituent analysis use the tests you saw in last weeks video. Remember that as the text points out each sentence has two possible interpretations. 
So there should be 2 analyses for each. 
For example for one analysis the test results are:
 - Who watched the movie? [We] did. 
 - What did we watch? ---> [the movie]
 - We watched [it] with Cher (substitution of 'the movie' with 'it')
 - Who did we watch the movie with? - [With Cher]
 - It was [the movie] that we watched with Cher.
 - It was [with Cher] that we watched the movie
... the constituents are [ [We] [watched [the movie][with Cher]] ]

On another analysis the constituents are:
 - What did we watch? --> [the movie with Cher]
 - We watched it (substitution of 'the movie with Cher')
 - It was [the movie with Cher] that we watched.
... the constituents are [ [We] [watched [the movie with Cher]] ]

Now continue for clauses vi and vii (you don't need to perform as many tests as I did, 2 will do).

[pages 26-29]
read carefully, especially page 27 where they explain in detail how the grammar works and how it is related to the tree and do exercise 1 on page 29.
